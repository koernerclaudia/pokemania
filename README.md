# Title: Poké-Mania
*(this document is WIP)*

## Description 
This is a version of a *Pokédex* (Pokémon-Index) set up during my Web Dev Training with CareerFoundry. The task was to build a small web application with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that loads data from an external API and enables the viewing of data points in detail.

## Built 
This database works with the the external open source Pokémon API 
https://pokeapi.co/

and Javascript. There is 1 external other resource - a background picture of Pikachu 
- taken from here: 
https://wallpapers.com/wallpapers/cute-pikachu-in-pokemon-anime-6z16jnz6bvgmfaqa.html

### The project consists of the following files: 
- 1 HTML file to setup the page.
- 1 CSS for all the styling
- 1 Javascript to pull info from the API and set up the functions for the list and the modals.

### How this app works now:
Currently it is a list of Pokémon Names showing up on buttons. When a Pokémon button is clicked it opens a modal that displays more information about the respective Pokémon

### Future feature endevours
In the next days, I am planning to implement:
- filters according to different characteristics of the Pokemons, e.g. by type
- better CSS layout of the modal
