# PokéMania

This was my first Javascript project :).

## Description 
This is a version of a *Pokédex* (Pokémon-Index) set up during my Web Dev Training with CareerFoundry. The task was to build a small web application with HTML, CSS, Bootstrap & JavaScript that loads data from an external API and enables the viewing of data points in detail.

## Built 
This database works with the the external 
<a href="https://pokeapi.co/" target="_blank">open source Pokémon API</a>.

and Javascript. There is 1 external other resource - a background picture of Pikachu 
- taken from here: <a href="https://wallpapers.com/wallpapers/cute-pikachu-in-pokemon-anime-6z16jnz6bvgmfaqa.html" target="_blank">Link to Example</a>


### The project consists of the following files: 
- 1 HTML file to setup the page.
- 1 CSS file for all the styling. (dist folder)
- 1 Javascript to pull info from the API and set up the functions for the list and the modals. (dist folder)
- Bootstrap 5 has been applied - I am using their modal and navbar.
- The JS folder also hosts Polyfill JS files that support the Pokemon API.

### How this app works now
Currently it is a list of Pokémon Names showing up on buttons. When a Pokémon button is clicked it opens a modal that displays more information about the respective Pokémon

### Run this project

1. You can fork the repository or download a zip to your local machine.
2. Open up the folder in your prefered Code Editor.
3. Open the Index file and play around with the app.
